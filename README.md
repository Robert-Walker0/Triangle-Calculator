# Lua Triangle Calculator

## A triangle calculator translated from C++ to Lua

This project was originally made in C++ by me in my time during college. It is a multiple file program that contains a version where you can use a triangle calculator in C++ or Lua. You should be able to use it with relative ease.

## Prerequisites

Before downloading this program you should have the following things installed depending on how you want to use this program 

* Lua 5.1 or higher
* C++14 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Robert-Walker0/Lua-Triangle-Calculator.git
```

2. Navigate to your project directory:
```bash
cd Lua-Triangle-Calculator
```

## Uninstalling 

### Windows

1. Delete the project directory:
```bash
rmdir "Lua-Triangle-Calculator" /s /q
```

### Linux

1. Delete the project directory:
```bash
rm -rf "Lua-Triangle-Calculator"
```

## Usage

### Lua Version 

To use the triangle calculator, run the command `lua src/lua/main.lua` file and follow the prompts to enter the side lengths.

### C++ Version

To use the triangle calculator for this version, compile `main.cpp` using the command `g++ src/cpp/main.cpp -o bin/main` and then run `bin/main` and follow the prompts to enter the side lengths to determine if something or not.

Please note that this version is behind the Lua version in some user friendly input aspects but it is still usable. It is the same version as I wrote in college, so that's why.
